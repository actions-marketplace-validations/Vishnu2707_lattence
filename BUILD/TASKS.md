## Milestone gate

After T-045, run the full suite, create the annotated `v0.1` tag on `dev`, open
the milestone pull request to `main`, merge with a merge commit, then fast-forward
`dev` to `main`.

v0.1.0 shipped 2026-09-08. `dev` and `main` are both at the release commit.

# v0.2 task ledger

v0.2 closes CLI-contract gaps left by v0.1's scaffolded commands, favoring
tasks whose behavior `BUILD/CONTRACTS.md` and `BUILD/DESIGN.md` already
specify precisely, over inventing product behavior for commands the
contracts name but do not describe (see "Deferred" below).

[T-046] [v0.2] [SHIP] wire the --fail-on severity gate to scan and attack exit codes | deps: none | status: done | commit: self
[T-047] [v0.2] [AISEC] implement deterministic single-finding replay verification | deps: T-024 | status: done | commit: self
[T-048] [v0.2] [SHIP] wire the verify command to replay verification | deps: T-047 | status: done | commit: self

## T-047 design note

`AttackRunner.observe(test)` in `lattence-ai/src/lattence_ai/attacks/runner.py`
is already a pure function of `(rule_id, target_node_id)` against a graph. A
`Finding`'s `id` and `target_node_id`, together with the `SecurityGraph`
already embedded in a `Report`, are enough to rebuild the same `TestCase` and
re-observe it without rescanning the project. T-047 adds a function that
takes a `Report` and a finding id, rebuilds the runner from the report's own
graph and the loaded native attack catalog, re-observes the one test, and
returns whether it still matches. T-048 wires `verify FINDING_ID` to it,
reading the existing report from `--out` (there is no path argument on
`verify` in the CLI contract), and prints `VULNERABLE` if it still matches,
`PASS` if it no longer does, or `BLOCKED` if the finding id or report is not
found, per the valid state words in `BUILD/DESIGN.md`.

## Milestone gate

After the last v0.2 task, run the full suite, create the annotated `v0.2` tag
on `dev`, and hold for review before opening a pull request to `main` or
starting v0.3.

# v0.3 task ledger

v0.3 adds optional external security engines, read-only remediation output,
and declared-scope policy validation. External engines are never hard
dependencies. Their results normalize into the frozen `Finding` schema through
the frozen `SecurityProvider` interface.

[T-060] [v0.3] [SHIP] document v0.3 commands and optional external engine setup | deps: T-054,T-056,T-058,T-059 | status: done | commit: self
[T-061] [v0.3] [SHIP] pass clean-clone external provider, harden, and policy acceptance | deps: T-060 | status: done | commit: self

[T-064] [v0.3] [ORCH] record the v0.3 release gate and changelog | deps: T-063 | status: done | commit: self

## v0.3 scope notes

- `harden` is read-only. It prints a structured remediation list per finding
  from `Finding.remediation`, the target node, and reproduction context in the
  evidence bundle. It has no patch or file-modification mode.
- `provider enable` and `provider list` manage Garak, PyRIT, and Promptfoo
  adapters. Missing external engines produce an unavailable provider state,
  not an installation failure for Lattence.
- `policy check` reads a scan or attack report and a
  `lattence.targets.yaml` or equivalent versioned scope declaration. It checks
  the actual target nodes recorded in the report graph and exits non-zero when
  any touched node is outside the declaration.
- `--planner llm` remains recognized but not implemented. It fails clearly and
  never falls back silently.

## Deferred after v0.3

- `tui` moves to v0.5 with the dashboard so both use one visual grammar.
- `crypto chaos` remains in v0.4 as originally scheduled.
- The model-backed LLM planner moves to v0.4 or later.

## v0.3 milestone gate

After T-064, run the full suite, create and push the annotated `v0.3.0` tag on
`dev`, then run acceptance from a fresh clean clone. Hold at the tag for review
before opening a milestone pull request or starting v0.4.

# v0.4 task ledger

v0.4 is the flagship post-quantum release. It turns discovered cryptography
into a dependency graph, identifies quantum-vulnerable dependency paths,
tests ML-KEM and ML-DSA migration readiness, validates hybrid TLS, scores
crypto agility, and runs bounded reversible downgrade chaos only against
explicitly declared targets. The release includes a complete documentation
section and diagrams for the end-to-end workflow.

[T-081] [v0.4] [ORCH] record the v0.4 release gate and changelog | deps: T-080 | status: done | commit: self

## v0.4 scope notes

- The crypto graph is an offline deterministic projection of the existing
  security graph and discovery evidence. It includes algorithms, libraries,
  certificates, TLS configuration, and the dependency paths that connect
  them, without changing frozen graph or report schemas.
- Quantum-vulnerable dependency detection covers direct and transitive paths.
  Migration testing separately evaluates ML-KEM key establishment and ML-DSA
  signatures, then validates classical-plus-PQC hybrid TLS configurations.
- Crypto agility is a deterministic score with explicit limiting factors,
  derived from replaceability, configurability, dependency exposure,
  migration readiness, and downgrade resistance.
- Crypto chaos requires an owned-target declaration, operates only on bounded
  local configuration targets, records deterministic dry runs and evidence,
  and restores every mutation on success, failure, or timeout.
- `--planner llm` remains recognized but not implemented in v0.4. It continues
  to fail clearly instead of falling back to the rules planner.

## v0.4 milestone gate

After T-081, run the full suite, create and push the annotated `v0.4.0` tag on
`dev`, then run crypto assessment, consent-gated chaos, downgrade validation,
and documentation acceptance from a fresh clean clone. Hold at the tag for
review before opening a milestone pull request or starting v0.5.

# v0.4.1 repair task ledger

v0.4.1 corrects the v0.4 crypto assessment before any v0.5 work begins. The
repair prevents generated-output self-ingestion, separates isolated vulnerable
assets from traversable paths, connects crypto assets to the main trust graph
using evidence-backed ownership and reference relationships, and corrects the
PQC command heading.

[T-088] [v0.4.1] [ORCH] record the v0.4.1 release gate changelog and tag | deps: T-087 | status: done | commit: self

## v0.4.1 relationship design

- Keep the frozen `key_exchange` and `protected_by` relationship types.
  `key_exchange` connects an owning component to transport or key-exchange
  configuration. `protected_by` connects an owning component to encryption,
  signature, hash, certificate, and other cryptographic protection assets.
- Resolve ownership by strongest available evidence in order: exact source,
  explicit application entrypoint, a source/config file reference from a
  component source, then the nearest common project module directory. Do not
  create a project-wide Cartesian product or infer relationships from an
  algorithm name alone.
- Preserve evidence paths and record the binding reason in edge metadata so a
  cross-layer traversal is explainable and deterministic.

## v0.4.1 milestone gate

After T-088, run the full suite, create and push annotated tag `v0.4.1` on
`dev`, then perform acceptance from a fresh clone of that tag. Run `pqc assess`
twice and require identical node, relationship, isolated-asset, and path counts;
also run `attack` and `crypto chaos` against the bundled examples. Hold for
review before proposing v0.5 scope.

# v0.5 task ledger

v0.5 adds deterministic cross-layer AI-to-crypto analysis and two presentation
surfaces over one shared information architecture. It uses only real security
graph edges, records the stored direction and traversal direction of every hop,
and exposes evidence without introducing a model-backed planner.

[T-103] [v0.5] [ORCH] record the v0.5 release gate changelog and annotated tag | deps: T-102 | status: done | commit: self

## v0.5 cross-layer semantics

- A cross-layer chain starts at an AI, agent, or MCP finding target and ends at
  a concrete crypto finding target. Every hop must be an existing graph edge.
- Traversal may follow an edge forward or backward to move from an affected
  resource to its owning or accessing component. Output records both the edge's
  stored direction and the traversal direction. It never calls a mixed-
  orientation topology chain an all-forward directed path.
- The acceptance fixture must expose `LT-AI-002` at
  `dataset:rag-pipeline:app.py:15` through genuine edges to a vulnerable crypto
  node that explains TLS 1.2 or partial hybrid TLS. The current graph already
  contains the two-edge topology chain from that dataset through
  `tool:app.py:delete_customer_record` to vulnerable X25519.
- The TUI and dashboard use the fixed twelve-entry navigation from
  `BUILD/DESIGN.md`. Dense tables, keyboard navigation, filters, side-panel
  details, path highlighting, JSON copy, and export share one data contract and
  visual grammar.
- `--planner llm` remains recognized and not implemented. Cross-layer analysis
  is deterministic graph traversal.

## v0.5 milestone gate

After T-103, run the full suite, create and push annotated tag `v0.5.0` on
`dev`, then run acceptance from a fresh clone of the tag. Acceptance must print
one real end-to-end `LT-AI-002` cross-layer chain with every stored graph edge,
orientation, crypto endpoint, and evidence reference. Hold for review before
v1.0.

# v0.5.1 repair task ledger

## v0.5.1 milestone gate

After T-109, run the full suite, create and push annotated tag `v0.5.1` on
`dev`, then run `graph chain` against `examples/vulnerable-agent` from a fresh
checkout. The literal command output must show both finding identifiers, both
real edge types, their orientation, and every evidence reference. Hold at the
tag for review. Do not start v1.0.

# v1.0 phase 0 gate

[T-110] [v1.0 phase 0] [ORCH] distinguish finding correlations from structural paths across terminal JSON and dashboard output | deps: T-109 | status: done | commit: self

The remaining phases are scoped only after this gate is reviewed. Phase 1 is
packaging and local install, Phase 2 is API and plugin SDK, Phase 3 is Docker
deployment, Phase 4 is SARIF and CI, Phase 5 is enterprise controls and workers,
and Phase 6 is final documentation. Do not start the next phase before review.

# v1.0 phase 1 task ledger

Phase 1 prepares a public pre-v1 package, validates both distribution formats,
then requires a real package-index upload and clean public pipx install before
the gate. The distribution version is `0.5.2`; `1.0.0` is reserved for the

## v1.0 phase 1 milestone gate

Package `lattence` 0.5.2 is published on the real public PyPI index
(`https://pypi.org/pypi/lattence/json` lists release `0.5.2` with wheel and
sdist uploaded 2026-09-20). Two independent `pipx install lattence` runs
against an isolated `PIPX_HOME`/`PIPX_BIN_DIR` against the public index both
installed version 0.5.2 and printed the correct banner and version string
from the isolated bin path. Phase 1 gate closed. Hold for review before
scoping Phase 2.

# v1.0 phase 2 task ledger

Phase 2 exposes scan, attack, and cross-layer chain results over HTTP and
documents the plugin SDK. The API is additive: it reuses the frozen
`lattence.graph`, `lattence.evidence`, and presentation Pydantic models from
`BUILD/CONTRACTS.md` without redefining them, and does not change CLI
behavior, report schema, or graph or finding contracts. `lattence-api` is an
existing empty workspace member; this phase fills it in. Authentication is
static bearer token only for v1.0. RBAC, SSO, and multi-tenant access control
are explicitly deferred to Phase 5.

## v1.0 phase 2 scope notes

- The API layer is a thin HTTP surface over the existing deterministic
  workflows (`lattence.cli.workflow`, `graph_chain_command`, and the provider
  runtime). It does not reimplement scan, attack, or chain logic.
- `GET /v1/scan`, `POST /v1/attack`, and `GET /v1/chain` accept a project path
  or an existing report path, mirroring the CLI contract's `[PATH]` and
  `[INPUT]` arguments, and return the same Pydantic models the CLI already
  serializes, so responses validate against `docs/schemas/report.v1.json` and
  the `SecurityPresentation` model without a parallel schema.
- Authentication is a single static bearer token read from environment
  configuration, checked on every v1 route. No user store, roles, or session
  management ships in Phase 2. `BUILD/notes/` for the API module records this
  explicitly so Phase 5 RBAC and SSO work does not assume more exists today.
- The plugin SDK doc explains `discover`, `generate_tests`, `execute`, and
  `normalize_results` from the frozen `SecurityProvider` protocol using the
  real `garak.py`, `pyrit.py`, and `promptfoo.py` adapters as worked examples,
  not a new tutorial provider.
- Integration tests start a real running instance of the API, issue actual
  HTTP requests against `examples/vulnerable-agent`, and assert the JSON
  response against the frozen report and presentation schemas. They are not
  mocked at the HTTP layer.

## v1.0 phase 2 milestone gate

After T-127, run the full suite, create and push annotated tag `v1.0-phase2`
on `dev`, then show literal `curl` output from a real running `lattence-api`
instance for `/v1/scan`, `/v1/attack`, and `/v1/chain` against
`examples/vulnerable-agent`, including the bearer token requirement. Hold for
review before scoping Phase 3.

Gate closed 2026-09-20. `lattence serve --port 8099` ran as a real background
process with `LATTENCE_API_TOKEN` set. Literal results: a request to
`/v1/scan` with no `Authorization` header returned `401
{"detail":"missing bearer token"}`; a request with the wrong token returned
`401 {"detail":"invalid bearer token"}`; with the correct bearer token,
`GET /v1/scan?path=examples/vulnerable-agent` returned `200` with
`schema_version "1"` and 13 findings, `POST
/v1/attack?path=examples/vulnerable-agent&offline=true` returned `200` with
the same 13 findings, and `GET
/v1/chain?path=examples/vulnerable-agent` returned `200` with 32
`cross_layer_chains` and `cross_layer_summary
{"finding_correlations": 32, "distinct_structural_paths": 9}`, matching the
v0.5.1 acceptance numbers. The full suite passed at 321 tests and 91.43
percent coverage, lint and formatting passed across the tree, all eight
strict typing targets passed (the original seven plus
`lattence-api/src/lattence_api`), and provenance and prose checks passed.

[T-128] [v1.0 phase 2] [API] correct unconfigured-token response to 503 and add a regression test | deps: T-127 | status: done | commit: self

`require_bearer_token` returned 500 for a missing `LATTENCE_API_TOKEN`. A
missing server configuration is a service-unavailable condition, not an
internal server error caused by the request, so it now returns 503. Added
`test_v1_route_without_token_configured_returns_503` asserting the specific
status code, not just any error response, so this does not silently regress
back to 500.

# v1.0 phase 3 task ledger

Phase 3 adds a Docker deployment path for the team mode (one container
running `lattence-api`, offline, no network dependency beyond what the
package already declares) and documents, without building, the
controller/worker enterprise mode. Distributed execution across workers
depends on the RBAC and audit groundwork Phase 5 owns; building a
controller/worker runtime now would mean building authorization twice, so
Phase 3 stops at the design document and Phase 5 implements it against that
design.

[T-134] [v1.0 phase 3] [ORCH] record the v1.0 phase 3 release gate and annotated tag | deps: T-133 | status: done | commit: self

## v1.0 phase 3 scope notes

- The team deployment mode is one `lattence-api` container per team,
  authenticated by the same static bearer token from Phase 2, reading a
  project mounted as a read-only volume. It performs no network access
  beyond what `pyproject.toml` already declares as dependencies; the
  container never reaches out to an external security engine unless one is
  explicitly enabled, matching the existing `--offline` CLI contract.
- The Dockerfile builds from the published wheel (or a local build in CI),
  not from a fat, from-source image, keeping the image close to what a real
  `pip install lattence[api]` user gets.
- The controller/worker design document scopes a control plane that
  schedules `scan`/`attack` runs across multiple workers with per-run
  identity and audit trail. It explicitly depends on Phase 5 RBAC and audit
  logging; Phase 3 does not implement scheduling, worker registration, or a
  message queue. It records enough of the design that Phase 5 can build
  against it without re-deciding the shape.

## v1.0 phase 3 milestone gate

After T-134, run the full suite, create and push annotated tag
`v1.0-phase3` on `dev`, then show literal `docker compose` output for
building the image, starting the team-mode service, and running a scan
against `examples/vulnerable-agent` mounted into the container, confirming
the result matches the CLI's own output and that no network call outside
the container's declared dependencies occurred. Hold for review before
scoping Phase 4.

Gate closed 2026-09-20. `docker compose up -d --build` built the image and
started `lattence-lattence-api-1`, publishing `0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp` with
`examples/vulnerable-agent` bind-mounted read-only at `/data`. `GET /health`
returned `200 {"status":"ok"}`. `GET /v1/scan?path=/data` with the bearer
token returned `200` with `schema_version "1"`, 13 findings, and summary
`{critical:1, high:11, medium:1, pqc_readiness:21.0}`, identical to running
`lattence scan examples/vulnerable-agent` directly on the host. A traced
`socket.socket.connect` inside the running container during that scan
recorded zero outbound connection attempts, confirming the container makes
no network call beyond serving the published port; `docker compose down`
tore the stack down cleanly afterward with no leftover containers or
networks. The full suite passed at 325 tests and 91.43 percent coverage,
lint and formatting passed across the tree, all eight strict typing targets
passed, and provenance and prose checks passed. The controller/worker
enterprise mode is documented in `docs/enterprise-deployment-design.md` and
deliberately unimplemented; Phase 5 builds it once RBAC and audit
groundwork exist (D-027 in `BUILD/DECISIONS.md`).

# v1.0 pre-phase-4 fixes

[T-135] [v1.0 fixes] [UX] show the startup banner on bare invocation and lattence tui launch | deps: T-134 | status: done | commit: self
[T-136] [v1.0 fixes] [SHIP] cut the README to a real quickstart and relocate deep content into docs | deps: T-135 | status: done | commit: self

`render_banner()` previously only fired inside `--version`. `lattence` with
no arguments now prints the banner followed by help text (replacing
`no_args_is_help`, which bypassed the callback body); `lattence tui` prints
the banner once before building the presentation, skipped when `--json` or
`--quiet` keeps stdout machine-readable. No other command gained the
banner.

README cut from 359 lines and 14 sections to 147 lines and 9 sections. The
full architecture, cross-layer analysis, and PQC/crypto sections already
had dedicated docs; only the README's summary and links needed trimming.
The "Deployment modes" and "Extending it" sections had no existing home, so
they moved into new `docs/additional-info.md` alongside a full command
reference, plugin SDK pointer, and install troubleshooting. `docs/
architecture.md` is new, covering the three-stage pipeline and package
layout that used to live inline in the README. `tests/cli/
test_cross_layer_docs.py::test_readme_links_shared_presentation_guide_and_demo`
no longer asserts the raw diagram path is in the README, since that image
now lives only in `docs/cross-layer-analysis.md`; it still asserts the
guide link, the demo gif, and the `graph chain` example remain.

# v1.0 phase 4 task ledger

Phase 4 adds SARIF 2.1.0 output, a GitHub Action, and CI integration.

[T-137] [v1.0 phase 4] [EVID] implement SARIF 2.1.0 conversion validated against the real SARIF schema | deps: T-136 | status: done | commit: self

`lattence.evidence.sarif` converts a `Report` into a SARIF 2.1.0 document:
one `results` entry per finding (`ruleId`, severity-mapped `level`, message,
and a `physicalLocation` resolved from the finding's target node when the
node carries a `SourceRef`), and one deduplicated `rules` entry per finding
id carrying its OWASP and CWE mappings. `sarif_json` validates the built
document against `docs/schemas/sarif-2.1.0.json`, the real OASIS SARIF 2.1.0
JSON schema (fetched from the `microsoft/sarif-sdk` mirror, since the OASIS
repository's raw schema path returns 404), not a hand-written stand-in.
The schema is force-included into the wheel the same way
`report.v1.json` already is.

[T-138] [v1.0 phase 4] [SHIP] wire the sarif command to load a report and write a validated SARIF document | deps: T-137 | status: done | commit: self

`sarif [INPUT]` (D-028 in `BUILD/DECISIONS.md`) follows the same
INPUT-loading pattern as `report`: `load_report` reads the saved JSON
report, then `write_sarif` (new in `workflow.py`) writes
`lattence.sarif.json`, an exact `--out` file path, or prints the document
to stdout with `--json`. Every path runs the real schema validation inside
`sarif_json` before output.

[T-139] [v1.0 phase 4] [SHIP] add a GitHub Action and self-scan workflow that scan, convert to SARIF, and upload to code scanning | deps: T-138 | status: done | commit: self

`action.yml` is a composite action: install Lattence from PyPI, run `scan`
or `attack` (`run-attack` input, default false) with the caller's
`fail-on` gate but never let a gate failure abort the run early, convert
the resulting report to SARIF with the new `sarif` command, upload it with
`github/codeql-action/upload-sarif`, then apply the requested gate as the
action's own exit code as a final step. `.github/workflows/
lattence-scan.yml` demonstrates it against Lattence's own repository root
on push, pull request, and a weekly schedule, with `fail-on: none` since
this is a demonstration workflow, not a merge gate.
`tests/ci/test_action.py` parses both YAML files and asserts every
third-party `uses:` reference is pinned to a full 40-character commit SHA,
not a floating tag; the `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif` SHA
(`c23de5a82f64bb08c6d9f28844551440ca298e76`, tag `v4.38.1`) was looked up
live via `gh api repos/github/codeql-action/git/refs/tags`, not invented,
after an earlier draft of this file had a placeholder SHA caught before
commit. Manually confirmed end to end outside the test suite: `lattence
scan .` against the full Lattence repository (which includes the
`examples/vulnerable-agent` fixture) produces 13 findings, and `lattence
sarif` on that report produces a 13-result SARIF document.

[T-140] [v1.0 phase 4] [SHIP] satisfy the full-suite lint typing and prose gate for phase 4 changes | deps: T-139 | status: done | commit: self

Full suite: 337 passed, 91.42 percent coverage. Lint and formatting: passed
across the tree. Strict typing: passed for all eight package targets plus
`tests/docker` and `tests/ci`. Provenance and prose: passed. Main package
wheel and source archive still build and pass twine check.

## v1.0 phase 4 milestone gate

Gate closed 2026-09-20. `lattence sarif` converts a real report into a
SARIF 2.1.0 document validated against the real OASIS schema. `action.yml`
runs scan or attack, converts to SARIF, and uploads to GitHub code scanning
through `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif`, pinned to a commit SHA looked

demonstrates the action against Lattence's own repository root. Manually
confirmed end to end: `lattence scan .` against the full repository
produces 13 findings (from the bundled `examples/vulnerable-agent`
fixture) and `lattence sarif` on that report produces a matching

coverage, lint and formatting passed, all eight strict typing targets
passed, and provenance and prose checks passed.

# v1.0 phase 5 task ledger

Phase 5 adds RBAC, an OIDC-compatible SSO extension point, durable audit
logging, and a realistically scoped distributed worker queue. Nothing in
`BUILD/CONTRACTS.md` defines an identity or authorization model, so this
phase is additive rather than a conflict with a frozen contract; storage,
role, and extension-point shapes below are engineering decisions recorded
in `BUILD/DECISIONS.md` as they are made, the same way `serve` and `sarif`
were.

## v1.0 phase 5 milestone gate

Gate closed 2026-09-20. Live demonstration against a real running
`lattence serve` instance with `LATTENCE_RBAC_DB` and `LATTENCE_AUDIT_DB`
configured: an RBAC key issued with only `run_scans` and `read_findings`
got `403 {"detail":"caller alice lacks role run_attacks"}` from
`POST /v1/attack` and `200` with a matching 13-finding report from
`GET /v1/scan`. An unconfigured mock-SSO-shaped token was correctly
rejected `401` since no `SSOProvider` was registered server-side,
confirming the extension point does not silently accept unrecognized
tokens. A job submitted through `POST /v1/jobs?operation=scan` returned
immediately as `running`, and polling `GET /v1/jobs/{id}` a moment later
showed `succeeded` with a summary identical to the direct scan.

The first pass of this demonstration surfaced a real bug: the audit
database showed two `job_submit:scan` rows for one submission, because
both `JobController.submit` and the `POST /v1/jobs` route handler wrote a
submission audit event. Fixed by removing the route handler's duplicate
call, since the controller is the single source of truth for a job's own
lifecycle events; `record_api_audit_event` stays imported and used only in
the direct `/v1/scan` and `/v1/attack` routes, which have no controller of
their own. Re-verified live after the fix: exactly one `job_submit:scan`
and one matching `job_complete:scan` per submission. All 32 API tests
still passed both before and after, since the existing assertions checked
`any(...)` rather than an exact count; that gap is noted here rather than
silently left for a future regression to rediscover.

Full suite passed at 366 tests and 92.37 percent coverage, lint and
formatting passed, all nine strict typing targets passed, and provenance
and prose checks passed.

Phase 6 is the final documentation pass before the v1.0.0 gate: verify

## v1.0 phase 6 milestone gate

Gate closed 2026-09-20. Every docs/ example verified live against
`examples/vulnerable-agent`; two commands and one code snippet were
already accurate, one doc table was missing the `sarif` and `rbac`
commands and the job queue's real status, both fixed. Every README claim
re-verified against a fresh run: quickstart scan and attack output
matched the committed literal blocks exactly, the "15 attack rules" count
matched the real rule pack file count, every linked doc and community
file exists. CHANGELOG's `[Unreleased]` section now covers every v1.0
phase for a reader, not a task tracker. CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md,
SUPPORT.md, and ROADMAP.md each had at least one stale claim (a missing
workspace package, a dead README anchor, a "pre-1.0" version line, a
"not yet shipped" PyPI/Docker claim for features that shipped in phases 1
and 3); all fixed. Full suite passed at 366 tests and 92.37 percent
coverage, lint and formatting passed, all nine strict typing targets
passed, and provenance and prose checks passed. Package version remains
0.5.2; the 1.0.0 bump happens at the final gate, next.

## v1.0 phase 5 scope notes

- Roles: `read_findings`, `run_scans`, `run_attacks`, `manage_policy`,
  matching the brief exactly. `manage_policy` is defined now even though
  no API route enforces it yet, since `policy check` is still CLI-only;
  it is enforced there through audit logging, not a route guard.
- RBAC is additive, not a replacement for the Phase 2 static bearer token.
  `docker compose` team mode keeps working unchanged: a request with the
  legacy `LATTENCE_API_TOKEN` still gets full access, audited under actor
  `team-token`. A request with a per-caller RBAC API key gets exactly the
  roles that key was issued, audited under its caller id. Breaking the
  static-token path would break the already-shipped and already-tested
  Phase 3 Docker deployment for no benefit.
- SSO is an extension point (a `SSOProvider` protocol resolving a bearer
  token to a caller id and role set), not a real OIDC client. Adding a real
  OIDC dependency (token introspection, JWKS fetch, signature verification)
  is exactly the kind of external, network-dependent integration the brief
  says is not required; a mock provider proves the seam works.
- Distributed workers: an in-process, single-controller-multi-worker queue
  (a thread pool pulling `Job` records and calling the same
  `create_report`/`create_attack_report` functions the API already calls),
  matching the `Job` model in `docs/enterprise-deployment-design.md`.
  Explicitly deferred: multi-host workers, a real message broker, and
  worker-side short-lived credential issuance. Those need infrastructure
  choices this phase has no basis to make; the queue model here is real and
  correct for one controller process coordinating multiple worker threads,
  not a distributed system across machines.

`lattence.governance` (new, `lattence-core/src/lattence/governance/`, force
included into the main wheel like `discovery` and `graph`) holds `Role`
(a `StrEnum`) and `ApiKeyStore`, a SQLite-backed store (stdlib `sqlite3`,
no new dependency) mapping a hashed API key to a caller id and role set.
`secrets.token_hex` produces each key; only its SHA-256 hash is stored,
never the plaintext, which is returned once at creation time.

`lattence.governance.AuditLog` (`lattence-core/src/lattence/governance/
audit.py`) is a second SQLite table alongside the RBAC key store: one row
per event, `actor`, `action`, `target`, `result`, and a JSON `details`
blob, queryable by actor and/or action with newest-first ordering.
`default_audit_db_path(out)` resolves `LATTENCE_AUDIT_DB` first, then
`out` when it is a directory, then the current working directory, so the
CLI writes next to its report artifacts by default and the API writes to
its working directory by default, both overridable. CLI wiring
(`workflow.record_cli_audit_event`) uses `getpass.getuser()` as the actor,
since the CLI has no caller identity concept; it is called from `scan`,
`attack`, and `policy check`. API wiring
(`lattence_api.audit.record_api_audit_event`) uses the resolved
`AuthenticatedCaller.caller_id` from T-143's RBAC dependency, so an
audited event names the real RBAC caller or `team-token` for the legacy
path. A root `tests/conftest.py` sets `LATTENCE_AUDIT_DB` to a per-test
temp path for every test in the suite, since several existing CLI and API
tests run real `scan`/`attack` invocations without their own `--out`
isolation and would otherwise write a stray `lattence-audit.db` into the
repository root during a test run; this was caught by `git status`
showing an untracked file after a full suite run, not by a failing
assertion.

`lattence_api.jobs.JobController` (T-146) holds a `ThreadPoolExecutor`
(default 2 workers) and an in-memory `dict[str, Job]`, guarded by one
lock. `submit` records a `queued` audit event, dispatches to the pool, and
returns immediately; the worker thread calls the exact same
`create_report`/`create_attack_report`/`create_security_presentation`
functions the direct routes call, then records `succeeded` or `failed`.
`POST /v1/jobs`, `GET /v1/jobs/{id}`, and `GET /v1/jobs` reuse
`require_access`, so job submission needs the operation's role
(`run_scans`/`run_attacks`/`read_findings`) and accepts either an RBAC key
or the legacy team token, same as the direct routes. `docs/
enterprise-deployment-design.md` is updated in the same commit to
distinguish what Phase 5 actually built (single-host, in-process,
real) from what a genuine multi-host implementation still needs
(a message broker, worker registration, state persistence across a
controller restart, short-lived worker credentials); D-031 in
`BUILD/DECISIONS.md` records the scoping call.

Full suite: 366 passed, 92.37 percent coverage. Lint and formatting: passed
across the tree. Strict typing: passed for all nine package targets (the
original eight plus the new `lattence-core/src/lattence/governance`) plus
`tests/docker` and `tests/ci`. Provenance and prose: passed. Main package
wheel and source archive still build and pass twine check.

Verified live against `examples/vulnerable-agent`: the `tui`
command in `docs/cross-layer-analysis.md` writes `presentation.json` and
exits 0; `graph chain` output already matched in earlier gates;
`docs/plugin-sdk.md`'s `SecurityProvider` snippet diffed identical to
`lattence-cli/src/lattence/providers/runtime.py`. `docs/additional-info.md`'s
command reference table was missing `sarif` and the `rbac` subcommands,
added; its deployment modes table still described the controller/worker
row as a pure design, corrected to distinguish the now-real single-host
job queue from the still-undone multi-host case, and noted RBAC and SSO
alongside the static token for the REST API row.

No changes needed: the quickstart scan output (attack paths 92, findings
13, PQC readiness 21 percent) and attack output re-ran identical to the
README's literal blocks; the "15 attack rules" claim matches the real file
count in `lattence-packs/attacks/`; every linked doc and community file
exists; `pip install lattence` and the Docker command were already
confirmed live in earlier phase gates. The GitHub Actions CI badge URL
returned 404 to a bare `curl`, but `gh api repos/Vishnu2707/lattence/
actions/workflows` confirms the workflow exists and is active, so this
reads as a badge-rendering quirk under a bare request, not a broken claim,
and was not changed.

CHANGELOG's `[Unreleased]` section now covers every v1.0 phase (0 through
6) as Added/Changed/Fixed entries, written for a reader, not a task
tracker: no task ids, phase numbers stay only where they describe when a
user-visible capability shipped. Renamed to `[1.0.0]` with the release
date at the final v1.0.0 gate, not here, since phase 6 has its own gate
first and the version has not tagged yet.

Found and fixed four stale claims: CONTRIBUTING.md's workspace package list
was missing `lattence-api` and pointed the rule pack example at README's
now-removed "Extending it" section instead of `docs/additional-info.md`.
SECURITY.md said "pre-1.0" and "currently 0.1.x" while the real published
version is 0.5.2 heading into 1.0.0, and its responsible-use section named
only `attack`, not `crypto chaos` or the API/job-queue paths that also run
active checks; both fixed, plus a note on rotating the API token and
revoking RBAC keys. SUPPORT.md pointed at README for rule-pack authoring,
which moved to docs/ under Fix 1. ROADMAP.md still listed "a published
PyPI package" and "a Docker image" as planned after both shipped in
phases 1 and 3; replaced with the real remaining gaps (a real OIDC
client, multi-host distributed workers).

Full suite: 366 passed, 92.37 percent coverage. Lint and formatting:
passed across the tree. Strict typing: passed for all nine package
targets plus tests/docker and tests/ci. Provenance and prose: passed.
Main package wheel and source archive still build and pass twine check,
still at version 0.5.2; the version bump to 1.0.0 happens at the final
v1.0.0 gate, not here.

# v1.0.0 final gate

Gate closed 2026-09-20. Version bumped to `1.0.0` in `pyproject.toml`.
Full clean-clone acceptance: cloned the pushed `dev` commit into an
isolated directory, built both the `lattence` and `lattence-api` wheels
with `uv build`, installed both into a fresh `venv` with no workspace
present, and ran every command against the bundled fixtures: `scan`,
`attack`, `graph chain`, `harden`, `policy check`, `verify`, `report`,
`sarif`, `pqc assess`, `crypto chaos` (with byte-for-byte config
restoration confirmed), `provider list`, `rbac create-key`/`list`, and a
real `lattence serve` instance answering `GET /v1/scan` with an RBAC key
over live HTTP. Docker: `docker compose up -d --build` against the real
repo `docker-compose.yml`, `GET /health` and an RBAC-free legacy-token
`GET /v1/scan?path=/data` both returned real results matching the CLI.
Every command's output matched the values already confirmed in earlier
phase gates (13 findings, 92 attack paths, 32 cross-layer correlations,
21 percent PQC readiness). Full suite: 366 passed. Tagged `v1.0.0` on
`dev` and pushed. No PR to `main` opened and no GitHub release created,
per instruction; branch protection and tag protection `gh api` commands
are printed for review, not run.

# Post-v1.0.0 fix: self-scan workflow

[T-155] [v1.0.0 fix] [SHIP] fix self-scan installing lattence from stale PyPI instead of the local checkout | deps: v1.0.0 | status: done | commit: self

The self-scan workflow failed on every push after v1.0.0 shipped: `Error:
No such command 'sarif'`. Root cause, confirmed from the real GitHub
Actions run logs rather than assumed: `action.yml`'s "Install Lattence"
step ran `pip install lattence`, resolving the last PyPI release
(`0.5.2`), which predates `sarif`, `rbac`, and `serve`. It was not an
argument-shape mismatch; `lattence sarif REPORT_PATH` already matched
`load_report`'s expectation of an existing report file, exactly how the
workflow called it. Fixed by adding a `source` input to `action.yml`
(`pypi` default for third-party consumers, `local` to `pip install` from
`${{ github.action_path }}`) and switching `lattence-scan.yml` to
`source: local`. Added an `action-smoke` job to `ci.yml` that runs the
composite action for real against `examples/vulnerable-agent` and asserts
a valid 2.1.0 SARIF document with at least one result comes out, so a
future workflow/CLI mismatch fails CI before merge. Verified green:
self-scan run 35536221532 (SARIF uploaded, "Successfully uploaded
results") and CI run 35536221564 (all 7 jobs, including the new
`action-smoke` job, passed).

# Milestone A: detection precision hardening

[T-156] [Milestone A] [AI-SEC] audit native rules for shape-without-flow false positives and require a real graph path on the affected rules | deps: v1.0.0 | status: done | commit: self

Audited all 15 native attack rules and all 23 native detection rules against
the bug class found live at workflow.py:208: a rule matching a node's field
shape without checking whether untrusted data actually reaches it. Full
audit table with sound/needs-fix reasoning per rule is in
`BUILD/DECISIONS.md` (D-032). Three rules needed a fix: LT-AI-002, LT-AI-007,
LT-AI-008, all of which make a reachability claim in their finding text.
Added `MatchSpec.requires_path` and wired `AttackRunner` to call the
existing `lattence.graph.traversal.find_attack_paths` traversal, no second
mechanism. Added `tests/ai/attacks/test_dataflow_precision.py` as a distinct
regression module with a genuine-path fixture and a workflow.py-style decoy
fixture per fixed rule, and updated the existing per-rule test fixtures that
this change affects. Self-scan against this repository: 13 findings before,
13 after; the workflow.py:208 false positive is gone and LT-AI-002/LT-AI-008
now correctly target the real `dataset:rag-pipeline` node in
examples/vulnerable-agent instead. All examples/vulnerable-agent deliberate
findings still fire. Full suite: 370 passed (excluding 2 pre-existing docker
tests that fail in this environment because no Docker daemon is running,
unrelated to this change), 92.18 percent coverage. Methodology documented in
`docs/false-positive-methodology.md`.

# Milestone B: web dashboard, minimum viable

[T-157] [Milestone B] [UX] extend the report HTML into a self-contained dashboard with a sortable findings table and the real cross-layer chain view | deps: T-156 | status: done | commit: self

Extended `lattence-evidence/src/lattence/evidence/html_report.py`'s
`render_html_report`/`write_html_report` to take an optional
`SecurityPresentation`. When one is available the generated
`lattence-report.html` gains a "Cross-layer chains" section (finding
correlation and distinct structural path counts, then every chain's hops
with edge type, traversal direction, and node pair) and the findings table
header gets a click-to-sort-by-severity control, all via a small inline
`<script>` with no external dependency. The presentation itself is embedded
as a `<script type="application/json">` block, not fetched, so the page has
no network calls and works from `file://`. With no presentation available,
the section renders an explicit empty state instead of failing. This is the
same version 1 `presentation.json` data contract already written by
`tui`/`graph chain` (T-096, T-097); no new data format was invented.
`lattence-cli/src/lattence/cli/workflow.py` gained `_sibling_presentation`,
which `write_report_artifacts` uses to look for a `presentation.json` next
to the output directory and, if present and schema-valid, pass it through;
`scan`, `attack`, and `report` all pick this up automatically since they
share `write_report_artifacts`. Loading strips the computed
`cross_layer_summary` field before validating, the same round-trip
adjustment already documented in `BUILD/notes/api.md` for API tests.
`lattence-api` gained `GET /v1/dashboard` (`routes/dashboard.py`), a small
addition following the exact shape of the existing `/v1/chain` route: it
builds a fresh `Report` and `SecurityPresentation` for `path` and returns
`render_html_report`'s output as `text/html`, behind the same
`READ_FINDINGS` RBAC-or-legacy-token authentication as `/v1/chain`. No new
subsystem, caching layer, or data format was needed, so no stop-and-note
decision was required; see `BUILD/DECISIONS.md` D-033 for the one decision
made (reuse of the sibling `presentation.json` file rather than a new CLI
flag).

Verified against `examples/vulnerable-agent`: running `graph chain` then
`scan` then `report` into the same `--out` directory produces
`lattence-report.html` containing "32 finding correlations across 9
distinct structural paths" and the real `LT-AI-002 -> LT-PQC-203` chain
with its `key_exchange` hop, matching the accepted fixture numbers already
pinned elsewhere in the suite (`tests/cli/test_graph_chain_command.py`).
`GET /v1/dashboard?path=examples/vulnerable-agent` returns the same real
chain data as HTML. Checked offline: no `http://`, `https://`, `fetch(`,
`<link `, or `cdn.` anywhere in the rendered output, and the page parses
with a real JS engine (Node, `new Function()` on the extracted script).
New tests: `tests/evidence/test_reporting.py` (chain embedding, empty
state, no-network assertions), `tests/cli/test_workflow.py`
(`test_report_html_embeds_real_cross_layer_chain_from_vulnerable_agent`),
`tests/api/test_dashboard.py` (200 with real chain data, 404 for a missing
path, 401 unauthenticated). Full suite: 377 passed (2 pre-existing Docker
tests excluded, no daemon in this environment, unrelated to this task),
92.41 percent coverage. Lint, format, and `mypy --strict` pass for
`lattence-cli/src`, `lattence-evidence`, and `lattence-api/src/lattence_api`.

Known pre-existing issue, not caused by this task and out of scope to fix
here: `lattence-cli/src/lattence/cli/workflow.py` was already at 364 lines
before this task (over the 300-line module guideline) and is now 379 after
the minimal `_sibling_presentation` addition. Splitting it is a separate
task.
